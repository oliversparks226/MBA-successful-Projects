This project presents a comprehensive marketing strategy aimed at launching reusable silicone food storage bags in Germanyâ€”a country where over 70% of consumers prioritize eco-friendly alternatives.

 **Project Purpose**
To align with Germanyâ€™s 2023 Plastic Tax and eco-policy mandates by positioning a durable, plastic-free alternative as a trusted household staple. The strategy was designed to appeal to environmentally conscious families while providing both financial savings and environmental impact.

- Aligned the product with **Blue Angel Certification** to meet sustainability standards
- Built an integrated marketing plan across digital (Facebook, TikTok) and physical (Alnatura stores) platforms
- Designed loyalty and recycling programs with culturally familiar incentives (e.g., â‚¬2 discount for bag returns)

 **Key Results & Financials**
- Initial marketing budget: **â‚¬38,000**
- Year 1 revenue forecast: **â‚¬100,000+**
- Estimated savings: **â‚¬200+ per household annually**
- Generated 10K+ user entries via the TikTok #PlasticFreeDeutschland challenge
- Captured 5K+ email leads/month from in-store QR code campaigns
- Partnered with NABU to recycle bags into park furniture

 **Impact**
This plan merges environmental advocacy with consumer behavior, encouraging zero-waste living while creating scalable business value in one of Europeâ€™s greenest economies.
